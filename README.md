# Quote Generator App

I just created a **Quote Generator App** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**!

## About the Project

This app allows users to generate quote dynamically using data fetched from an API. Itâ€™s a simple yet functional project designed to help me practice and apply JavaScript concepts such as:

- **Fetch API**: To retrieve data from the API.
- **Promises**: To handle asynchronous operations.
- **Event Listeners**: To interact with the app.

### Features
- Input a category to fetch relevant course data.
- Dynamically display course details fetched from the API.
- Simple and clean UI.

## Why I Built This

Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and wanted to apply my knowledge in a practical way. This project helped me:
- Understand how to work with APIs.
- Practice handling asynchronous data.
- Learn how to manipulate the DOM dynamically.

## How It Works
1. Enter a Quote Category in the input field.
2. Press the "Generate" button to fetch and display data.
3. The app shows the quote details, such as the quote and author.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
